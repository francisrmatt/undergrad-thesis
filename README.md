# Undergraduate Thesis

### Compression of Wi-Fi 802.11ax Data using Large Language Models

Codebase for undergraduate thesis.

Run `install.sh` to download environment and then `source setup.sh` to use.
`go.py` CLI can generate parameters as described in `params/MODEL/info.yml` but data will need to be generated in `MATLAB`.
Please email to mfra0712 USYD address should there be any issues.
Majority of testing code was omitted to make repo light, avoided putting model parameters in etc.
